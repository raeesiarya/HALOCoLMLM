# Run the full HALO audit suite on Co-LMLM: the standard three-state audit,
# the entanglement sweep, and the adversarial-closure evaluation.
#
# Invoke from the HALO repo, but it executes inside the public Co-LMLM
# environment (Co-LMLM ships its own `lmlm` package, so it must run there):
# it clones/syncs the checkout if needed, cd's into it, and puts HALO's src
# on PYTHONPATH.
#
# The three phases are separate evaluation modes and run sequentially — they
# share one GPU, and the sweep/adversarial phases share one FULL pass (the
# <prompts>_full/ directory). Every phase is resumable, so if the suite dies
# partway, re-running it skips everything already on disk. All phases log to
# W&B as separate runs named <output-dir>__<mode>.
#
# Wall-clock tip: phase 2 shards cleanly by radius. Run one single-radius
# sweep first (e.g. RADIUS_GRID=0.95:0.95:0.05) so the shared FULL pass is
# materialized, then launch the remaining radii as parallel processes (one
# GPU each, same OUTPUT_DIR — each writes its own sweep_rho_*.jsonl), and
# finally re-run the full grid: it resumes every per-radius file and only
# computes the analysis. Do NOT shard by prompt file subsets — neighbor
# sets N(f) are defined within a prompt file.
#
# The suite runs every published evaluation by default: the three phases
# above, plus the DEL-OFF sensitivity control and the deletion-policy matrix.
# SUITE_PHASES narrows that when you need it:
#   all (default) = standard,sweep,adversarial,del-off,policy
#   core          = standard,sweep,adversarial
#   or an explicit comma-separated subset, e.g. SUITE_PHASES=standard,policy
# Narrowing is mainly useful for resuming a partial run or iterating on one
# phase; the del-off and policy phases are a full standard audit per variant
# (one and four respectively, after de-duplication against phase 1), so the
# default suite is roughly three times the cost of `core`.
#
# Optional:  CO_LMLM_DIR (defaults to ../Co-LMLM next to this repo; cloned
#            from GitHub if absent), INDEX_DIR, PROMPTS, OUTPUT_DIR,
#            SUITE_PHASES, STANDARD_CLOSURE, SWEEP_CLOSURE,
#            ADVERSARIAL_CLOSURE, RADIUS_GRID, NEIGHBOR_MODE,
#            NEIGHBOR_MIN_COUNT, DEL_OFF_MODE
# Extra flags are passed through to every phase, so keep --limit consistent
# across re-runs: the shared FULL pass is resumed wholesale and only covers
# the facts it was built with.
