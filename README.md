# LMLM Audit

![Tests](badges/tests.svg)
![Coverage](badges/coverage.svg)

This repository contains the code for [*Auditing Forgetting in Limited Memory
Language Models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.00605).

The original audit was built for relational LMLMs. We are now extending it to
[Co-LMLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.07707), where facts are stored as free-form
text and retrieved with continuous keys.

## What are we testing?

LMLMs are designed to keep factual knowledge in an external memory. In theory,
deleting a fact from that memory should make the model forget it. In practice,
the answer may still be available through the model's parameters or through a
different, related memory entry.

For each fact, we run the model in three settings:

- `FULL`: the memory is unchanged and retrieval is enabled.
- `DEL-ON`: the target entry is hidden, but retrieval remains enabled.
- `DEL-OFF`: the target entry is hidden and retrieval is disabled.

Comparing these runs helps us distinguish parametric memory from answers that
are recovered through retrieval. The audit also saves the retrieved entries so
we can inspect where an answer came from.

## Current status

The repository currently supports:

- the original rel-LMLM audit;
- a shared audit format that does not require subject-relation pairs;
- a Co-LMLM backend built around the public model and index interfaces;
- non-destructive deletion by filtering selected entry or source IDs at search
  time;
- retrieval traces, query-embedding sidecars, and cross-state forgetting
  metrics;
- an oracle smoke-test mode that uses the entry retrieved during `FULL` as the
  deletion target; and
- materialized deletion closures (`--closure geometric,semantic,provenance`)
  built from the `FULL` pass, with per-entry attribution artifacts and a
  run-time semantic backstop; and
- entanglement sweeps (`--radius-grid 0.95:0.70:0.05`) that measure deletion
  efficacy against collateral damage on neighbor facts
  (`--neighbor-mode cosine|same-source`) and report per-fact operating
  curves and the entanglement gap G(f); and
- a representational-leakage probe (`lmlm-audit-probe`) that fits a linear
  readout on frozen query embeddings over a fact-disjoint split and reports
  L_rep and Δ_rep against the behavioral DEL-OFF baseline; and
- an adversarial-closure evaluation (`--adversarial`) that injects synthetic
  survivor entries just outside the deletion radius, reports the evasion
  rate Ev(ρ, ε) per value template and topology, and scores a geometry-only
  margin predictor (AUROC) for retrieval-mediated leakage; and
- a rel-LMLM parity path so the closure, entanglement sweep, and adversarial
  evaluations run against the relational backend's sentence-embedding
  retrieval too (geometric and semantic predicates only — relational triples
  carry no provenance), enabling the G(f) = 0 baseline comparison.

The Co-LMLM backend has unit-test coverage, but it still needs to be run against
the full released checkpoint and index. The next research step is to move past
single oracle entries and identify all memory entries that express the same
fact.

## Repository structure

The audit code lives in `src/lmlm_audit/`, split into three subpackages:

- `core/` — backend-agnostic pieces: the abstract backend interface, database
  states, forgetting metrics, answer-equivalence checks, and prompt/example
  handling.
- `models/` — one subpackage per audited model, so new backends slot in
  alongside the existing two:
  - `models/rel_lmlm/` — the original relational-LMLM backend: model loader,
    triple database, and deletion logic.
  - `models/co_lmlm/` — the Co-LMLM backend: wrappers around the public model
    and index interfaces, search-time ID filtering for non-destructive
    deletion, and answer extraction.
- `cli/` — the `lmlm-audit` entry point (`run_audit.py`), the audit runner, and
  result/metrics reporting.

Databases and prompt sets are under `data/`: the released LMLM database with
six prompt types, and three custom domains (countries, politicians, sports)
with base/alias/collision/noise variants.

## Setup

The project uses Python 3.12 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

For the original rel-LMLM audit, place the upstream LMLM repository at
`../LMLM`, then run:

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest
```

## Running the rel-LMLM audit

```bash
uv run lmlm-audit \
  --database-path data/custom_databases/countries/base.json \
  --prompt-files data/custom_databases/countries/prompts/base/prompts_direct_questions.jsonl \
  --states FULL DEL-ON DEL-OFF \
  --output-dir outputs/audit \
  --wandb-activation off
```

The runner writes one JSONL result file per prompt set, along with per-state and
cross-state metric CSVs.

The audit deletes non-destructively (it filters retrieval results at query
time and never mutates the triple database), which matches how upstream builds
its retriever: the FAISS index is constructed once on first use and never
rebuilt. Two consequences to keep in mind: do not mutate the base database
mid-session (the frozen index would go stale), and the upstream on-disk
retriever cache is keyed only on `<database_name>_<triple_count>`, so two
different databases that share a name and triple count collide in that cache —
give distinct databases distinct names.

## Running the Co-LMLM audit

Co-LMLM and rel-LMLM both use the Python package name `lmlm`, so they should be
kept in separate environments. Run this command from the public Co-LMLM
environment after downloading its model and index:

```bash
cd /path/to/Co-LMLM

PYTHONPATH=/path/to/HALOCoLMLM/src:src \
uv run python -m lmlm_audit.cli.run_audit \
  --backend colmlm \
  --colmlm-source-path . \
  --colmlm-model-path /path/to/CoLMLM-360M-FW \
  --index-path /path/to/co-lmlm-wiki-index \
  --entries-db-path /path/to/co-lmlm-wiki-index/entries.db \
  --prompt-files /path/to/prompts.jsonl \
  --bootstrap-oracle-from-full \
  --states FULL DEL-ON DEL-OFF \
  --output-dir /path/to/results
```

An example prompt file is available at
[data/colmlm/prompts_smoke.example.jsonl](data/colmlm/prompts_smoke.example.jsonl).
For a proper experiment, each prompt should use a reviewed deletion manifest
rather than relying on the oracle bootstrap option.

For the full FineWeb-Edu + Wikipedia index, pass `--faiss-mmap` to memory-map
the ~59 GB FAISS file instead of loading it into RAM, and use `--nprobe` to
raise IVF recall (the geometric closure depends on approximate IVFPQ search;
the value used is recorded in each closure manifest). The index's faiss-id
mapping determines whether `--use-sqlite-id-mapping` applies — check whether
the downloaded bucket ships a mapping `.db` or only the `.txt` map before
enabling it.

## Comparing rel-LMLM and Co-LMLM in one run

`lmlm-audit-compare` runs both backends as a single comparison. Because their
`lmlm` packages cannot share a process, each backend runs in its own
environment as a subprocess (pass a uv project dir per leg, or an explicit
interpreter with `--rel-python` / `--colmlm-python`). The two legs run
concurrently, and their metric CSVs are merged — tagged with a `backend`
column — under `<output-dir>/comparison/`.

```bash
uv run lmlm-audit-compare \
  --prompt-files /path/to/prompts.jsonl \
  --output-dir outputs/compare \
  --rel-env . \
  --rel-database-path data/custom_databases/countries/base.json \
  --colmlm-env /path/to/Co-LMLM \
  --colmlm-source-path /path/to/Co-LMLM \
  --colmlm-model-path /path/to/CoLMLM-360M-FW \
  --index-path /path/to/co-lmlm-wiki-index \
  --entries-db-path /path/to/co-lmlm-wiki-index/entries.db \
  --bootstrap-oracle-from-full \
  --radius-grid 0.95:0.70:0.05 \
  --closure geometric,semantic
```

Shared evaluation flags (`--radius-grid`, `--closure`, `--adversarial`, the
neighbor and closure options, `--states`, `--limit`) are forwarded to both
legs; backend-specific connection flags go to the matching leg only.
Provenance closure is Co-LMLM-only, so use `--closure geometric,semantic` for
comparisons. Pass `--skip-rel` / `--skip-colmlm` to re-run a single leg into
the same comparison tree. The two backends usually live on different machines
(the Co-LMLM index is large), so in practice the Co-LMLM leg runs on the
cluster; use `--skip-colmlm` locally and merge later, or point `--colmlm-env`
at a reachable environment.
